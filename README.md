Chitter was a small weekend challenge I undertook for makers to make a Twitter clone.

I used Ruby and web HTML.

The app is hosted here: https://chitter-challenge-jer.herokuapp.com/
The app allows the user to sign up with a username and password, log in with these.
Then they can make new peeps(tweets) and see other's in reverse chronological order, just like twitter!)
The user can also log out.

***DO NOT USE REAL EMAIL AND PASSWORD FOR LOGIN AS IT IS NOT SECURE***
